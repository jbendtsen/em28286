# em28286

This repository is a small collection of tools that I've created to gain understanding of the Empia 28286 capture card, specifically at the level of using it in a Unix-based OS.

## Tools

* analyse.c
	* Takes a .pcap file generated by USBPcap and outputs information relevant to controlling the device
	* Includes an option to generate a list of commands for usbshell (see below)
* dump_eeprom.c
	* Self-explanatory
* usbshell.c
	* A general-purpose tool for sending and receiving USB transfers with libusb
